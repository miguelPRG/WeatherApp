## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
- **Backend:** [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **API:** [Tomorrow.io Weather API](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Creating .env file

- Create a `.env` file and add your [Tomorrow.io API key](https://app.tomorrow.io/development/keys):
    ```
    TOMORROW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### Option 1: Local Setup (Node.js & npm)

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miguelPRG/WeatherApp.git
cd WeatherApp
```

#### 2. Setup the Backend

1. Go to the backend folder:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```
    The backend will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### 3. Setup the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal and go to the frontend folder:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 2: Using Docker (Development Only)

#### üê≥ Docker (Development Only)

This project includes Docker configuration to simplify **development setup**.  
It allows you to run both frontend and backend in isolated containers without installing Node.js or npm locally for each part.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Docker is configured **for development purposes only**, not for production deployment. For production, you would need to build the frontend and deploy containers to a server or a cloud service. This project runs in [Render](https://render.com/)(backend) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)(frontend)

#### 1. Start the App with Docker

From the project root, run:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start:

. Backend on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
. Frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### 2. Stop the Containers

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Usage

- On load, the app requests your location and shows weather data automatically.
- Search for any city to get its forecast.
- Data is cached in local storage to reduce API calls.
- Explore charts for temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, evapotranspiration, and UV index.
