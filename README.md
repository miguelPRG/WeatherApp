## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
- **Backend:** [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **API:** [Tomorrow.io Weather API](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miguelPRG/WeatherApp.git
cd WeatherApp
```

### 2. Go to develop branch

Switch to the **develop** branch for local frontend-backend communication, as it points to the correct backend URL.

```sh
git switch develop
```

### 2. Creating .env file

- Create a **.env** file **inside the backend directory** and add your [Tomorrow.io API key](https://app.tomorrow.io/development/keys):
    ```
    TOMORROW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### Option 1: Using Docker

#### üê≥ Docker (Development Only)

This project includes Docker configuration to simplify **development setup**.  
It allows you to run both frontend and backend in isolated containers without installing Node.js or npm locally for each part.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Docker is configured **for development purposes only**, not for production deployment. For production, you would need to build the frontend and backend separately and deploy each one to a server or a cloud service. This project runs in [Render](https://render.com/)(backend) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)(frontend).  

##### 1. Start the App with Docker

From the project root, run (as administrator):

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start:

. Backend on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
. Frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

##### 2. Stop the Containers

We can also stop the container to shutdown the application as a whole.

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Local Setup (Node.js & npm)

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### 1. Setup the Backend

1. Go to the backend folder:
```sh
    cd backend
```
2. Install dependencies:
```sh
    npm install
```
3. Start the backend server:
```sh
    npm run server
```
    The backend will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### 3. Setup the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal and go to the frontend folder:
```sh
    cd frontend
```
2. Install dependencies:
```sh
    npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```sh
    npm run dev
```
    The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

- On load, the app requests your location and shows weather data automatically.
- Search for any city to get its forecast.
- Data is cached in local storage to reduce API calls.
- Explore charts for temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, evapotranspiration, and UV index.

## Error Handling

### Location Not Found

Here is a screenshot where the user's current location is not correctly fetched, weather if it's because the user's browser has not location permissions or some other problem.

### City Not Found

Here is a screenshot where the user's asked city was not found.

## Unit Tests

This project also includes unitary tests in **frontend/src/tests** directory. In order to them, run the following commands:

```sh
cd frontend
npm run test
```

## CI/CD
This project is operating in constant **integration** and **deployment**. Every time a **commit** is pushed in several diferent branches, the GitHub workflow is executed. This workflow runs 4 jobs: **install-in-cache-and-audit**, **test-frontend**, **build-app**, **deploy**
